# pydexcom

A simple Python API to interact with Dexcom Share service. Used to get **real time** Dexcom CGM sensor data.

### Setup

1. Download the [Dexcom G6 / G5 / G4](https://www.dexcom.com/apps) mobile app and [enable the Share service](https://provider.dexcom.com/education-research/cgm-education-use/videos/setting-dexcom-share-and-follow).

    *Note: the service requires setup of at least one follower to enable the share service, but `pydexcom` will use your credentials, not the follower's.*

2. Install the `pydexcom` package.
    ```python
    pip3 install pydexcom
    ```

### Usage

```python
>>> from pydexcom import Dexcom
>>> dexcom = Dexcom("username", "password") # add ous=True if outside of US
>>> bg = dexcom.get_current_glucose_reading()
>>> bg.value
85

>>> bg.mmol_l
4.7

>>> bg.trend
4

>>> bg.trend_description
'steady'

>>> bg.trend_arrow
'→'

>>> bg.time
datetime.datetime(2020, 5, 6, 18, 18, 42)

>>> # Write to file: 
>>> bg_list = dexcom.get_glucose_readings(max_count=5)
>>> import json
>>> with open('bg_file.json', 'w') as f:
>>>     for bg in bg_list:
>>>         f.write(json.dumps(bg.json)+"\n")

>>> # Read from file: 
>>> bg_list = []
>>> from pydexcom import GlucoseReading
>>> with open('bg_file.json', 'r') as f:
>>>     for line in f.readlines():
>>>         bg_list.append(GlucoseReading(json.loads(line)))

```

### FAQ

<details>
<summary>What do I need to get started?</a></summary>
<br/>
If you are currently on the Dexcom CGM system, all you need is the appropriate mobile app with the Dexcom Share service enabled.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Where is this package being used?</a></summary>
<br/>
For now this package is mainly being used in the <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/33852">Dexcom home assistant integration</a>, but is generic enough to be used in lots of applications.
In fact, reddit user paulcole710 used it to track glucose levels <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-project-diy-dexcom-glucose-tracker">using a Raspberry Pi and e-ink display</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why not use the <a href="https://developer.dexcom.com/">official Dexcom Developer API?</a></summary>
<br/>
The official Dexcom API is a great tool to view trends, statistics, and day-by-day data, but is not suitable for real time fetching of glucose readings.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How can I let you know of suggestions or issues?</summary>
<br/>
By all means submit a pull request if you have a feature you'd like to see in the next release, alternatively you may leave a issue if you have a suggestion or bug you'd like to alert me of.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Are there any features in development?</summary>
<br/>
Sure, I'm thinking of implementing a session status checker, or maybe an asynchronus version. That being said, simplicity - getting real time blood glucose information - is most important to this package.
